									SciberBrain is a collection of free resources for addressing controversial aspects of Genetic engineering, Stem cells, Vaccinations, Evolution, Clinical trials and Brain chemistry. 

									Resources have been differentiated for two ability levels: Standard (KS3/4) and NEW Advanced (post-16). Resources include background science presentations, dialogue stimuli, videos and quizzes which have been selected by teachers and scientists from a range of sources. 

									 Step 1: Select the topic you would like your students/audience to discuss  

									Step 2: Show the background science presentation to your class/audience 

									Step 3: Get students/participants to explore the interactive links and opinions  

									Step 4: Have an informed class/group discussion

									See the Facilitators section for lesson plans, event ideas and dialogue facilitation tips

									The Biochemical Society is a UK based  Learned Society for the advancement of biochemistry. The major charitable objective of the Society is to promote biochemistry in a variety of educational contexts. We seek to inspire the next generation of young bioscientists and promote a better understanding of the key biological challenges faced by citizens of the future. The Society also fulfills its charitable mission through scientific conferences, publications, grant schemes and career events, many of which are resourced by our membership.Other online resources from the Biochemical Society include:The Understanding Biochemistry issues of Essays in Biochemistry provide up to date overviews of key concepts in biochemistry.
